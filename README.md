Gameday is a simple web application that is designed to give an indication of how enjoyable an NBA game will be without giving away the result.

It does this by determining a rating for each game.  The rating is calculated automatically based on points difference and lead changes throughout the game.

Hopefully I'll get to a point where I include other metrics such as social media chatter.  I'm sure other aspects would be helpful too.

It was also created as an exercise to use the MEAN stack.  That is: MongoDB / Mongoose / Express / AngularJs / NodeJs.  Aka "full stack javascript".

It is currently running at http://www.bestgametowatch.com and is hosted on the OpenShift PAAS environment.
